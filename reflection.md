Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
In the house and library classes, I overloaded the goToFloor methods to account for these buildings potentially having elevators, and I overloaded the elevator method from the building class. I overloaded the same for the cafe class, but tried to make it so that a cafe couldn't have an elevator (I think I need some direction on that).
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
The elevator methods worked in some files but not others, and I had to through to make sure my naming was consistent and such. I'd say that your first submission doesn't have to be perfect, and it's okay to submit an assignment where you need some more guidance on an aspect of it.
