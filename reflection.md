- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
In the house and library classes, I overloaded the goToFloor methods to account for these buildings potentially having elevators, and I overloaded the elevator method from the building class.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
